Behavioral patterns:


Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing. It maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

Creational patterns:


Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
The Singleton pattern solves two problems at the same time, violating the Single Responsibility Principle:
1. Ensure that a class has just a single instance 
2. Provide a global access point to that instance
